welcome to the newburgh creates community blog.

at newburgh creates, we like to build robots, do art, and play with comupters.

we help people to learn and teach about STEAM - science, technology, engineering, arts, and math.

we will be writing more blog posts soon about things like our ongoing programs, meetings, and ideas.
