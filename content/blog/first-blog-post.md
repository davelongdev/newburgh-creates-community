welcome to the newburgh creates community blog.

at newburgh creates, we like to build robots, do art, and play with comupters.

we teach classes, run summer camps and meetups, and offer one to one tutoring.  we have classes and workshops on topics like computer programming, game design, robotics, art and sketching, fashion design, and math.

we help people to learn and teach about STEAM - science, technology, engineering, arts, and math.

we will be writing more blog posts soon about things like our ongoing programs, meetings, and ideas.
