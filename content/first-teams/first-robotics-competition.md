### CAD programs

what is CAD?  Computer Assisted Design.

- **TinkerCAD** - TinkerCAD is a great starting point for learning about CAD.  it's free to use and runs in the browser.  it has a small number of tools and menus, so it's pretty easy to learn.  it can also be good for making something simple quickly.  here is the link to our newburgh creates - [TINKERCAD CLASSROOM](https://www.tinkercad.com/joinclass/XFWXMA2SS) -

- **FreeCAD** - Freecad is a great free and open source program that runs locally on linux, windows, and mac (requires installation) and saves files locally.

- **OnShape** - Onshape is a proprietary robust CAD program that runs in the brower and saves files in the browser.  it allows collaboration on projects and has a built-in version control.  you can find onshape files for many REV parts that you can use for 3d printing.

- **Solidworks** - Solidworks is a proprietary CAD program that is very robust.  it is used by many professionals in industry and in universities that teach CAD.  Solidworks provides FTC teams with student licenses to use the software.

- **Autocad Fusion** - Fusion is another popular CAD program that is made by autodesk.  FTC students may want to try fusion out.
